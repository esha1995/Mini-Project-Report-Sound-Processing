This is the report written for a MatLab implementation of the simple HRTF model presented in the paper "An efficient HRTF model for 3d sound" by  C.P. Brown and R.O. Duda.
(10.1109/ASPAA.1997.625596)

This was made as a mini project for the course Sound Processing on the master program "Sound and Music Computing" at Aalborg University Copenhagen.
